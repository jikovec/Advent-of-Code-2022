# Advent-of-Code-2022
My [Advent of Code 2022][aoc-2022] solutions in Python.
This repository holds a separate Python project for each day.

## Run solutions

Each Python project contains a `input.txt` file, holding the puzzle input. Simply
run the Python project to get the solution.

## Other years

## Note

I lost my solutions and I am way too lazy to do it all again.
